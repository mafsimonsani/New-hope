Given N, produce the correct sentence

# WC '15 Contest 2 J1 - A New Hope

You might be aware that the events of the Star Wars saga took place a long time ago, in a galaxy that was rather far away. But just how far away was it? We can try to describe it by repeating the word far a certain number of times in the following sentence format:

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...
In the above example, the word far is repeated twice. However, we'd instead like to repeat it exactly N (1 ≤ N ≤ 5) times without changing the rest of the sentence at all. There should be a comma right after each occurrence except for the last one.

Given N, can you produce the correct sentence?

Input Specification

The input consists of a single integer N.

Output Specification

Output on a single line the appropriate sentence with far repeated N times. It must match the correct answer exactly!
